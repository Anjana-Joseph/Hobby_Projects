# 2: Rock-Paper-Scissors

This task is a Rock-Paper-Scissors game application built using Tkinter, a standard Python library for creating Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). The game allows the user to play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer and keeps track of the score.

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the task directory (`codsoft_taskno.2`):
```bash
cd codsoft_taskno.2
```
2. Run the Python script by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```bash
python rock_paper_scissors_game.py
```
or, if you're using Python 3:
```bash
python3 rock_paper_scissors_game.py
```
3. The game window will open. You can start playing Rock-Paper-Scissors using the GUI.

## Features

- Rock-Paper-Scissors: Play the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors with buttons for each option.
- Score Tracking: The application tracks and displays both the user's and computer's scores.
- Play Again: Start a new round without resetting the scores using the "Play Again" button.
- Reset Game: Reset the game scores to zero with the "Reset" button.
- User-Friendly Interface: The game is easy to use with clear labels and buttons.
  
## Example

```bash
python rock_paper_scissors.py
# A game window will open
# Click on "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors" to make your move
