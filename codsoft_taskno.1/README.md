# 1: Calculator

This task is a simple calculator application built using Tkinter, a standard Python library for creating Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## How to Run

1. **Navigate to the task directory** (`codsoft_taskno.1`):

    ```bash
    cd codsoft_taskno.1
    ```

2. **Run the Python script** by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    ```bash
    python calculator.py
    ```

    or, if you're using Python 3:

    ```bash
    python3 calculator.py
    ```

3. The calculator will open in a window. You can start performing arithmetic operations using the GUI.

## Features

- **Addition**, **Subtraction**, **Multiplication**, and **Division**.
- **Parentheses** support for complex expressions.
- **Clear Button** (`C`) to reset the current calculation.
- **Decimal Support** for floating-point arithmetic.

## Example

```bash
python calculator.py
# A calculator window will open
# Enter a number, then an operator, and another number, then press "=" to see the result.
